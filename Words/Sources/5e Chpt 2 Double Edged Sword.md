**Chapter 2. Double Edged Sword**

The loss of several Bernardenfeld sheep was the latest feud between the Bernardenfeld and Schruteborn families. Schruteborn dogs were blamed for the loss. Charged with conducting and independent investigation, our group of ardent adventurers, instead, found that a recent earthquake had opened a fissure in the earth. The sheep has simple fallen into the fissure. More than just deceased sheep were discovered in the fissure. The earthquake had also created an entrance to a tomb complex.

The tomb, it was discovered, was the last resting place for an ancient King, King Valencourt. Murals along the hallways illustrated his life and his passions, and revealed that he was illiterate. Moreover, the group discovered that he was also not of noble birth. He built his kingdom from nothing and, apparently spent the resulting wealth in the construction of this tomb; the construction costs and magics involved would have been terribly expensive. The culmination of the tomb was the king court chamber and burial tomb. His court of nobles was doomed to spend eternity with him as there skeletal spirits continued to argue and bicker of protocol, lineage and succession planning for the kingdom. When the true nature of the king and his demise where revealed, their spirits were released. One skeleton did remain; the court Chamberlain.

The group emerged triumphant from the tomb. The shining sun a welcome greeting from the surface world. It is late afternoon and the skies are clear. A walk back to Edanshep of 8 miles will take several hours.

**Edanshep**

The group is warmly greeted by Ned Tilhook, who owns the local Inn, “The Hook and Barrell.” He asks them to take a table in the tavern while he tells the Mayor of their arrival.

Blane Coopersmith, the Mayor arrives shortly and greets the group warmly. He is a human of medium build with dark brown hair and beard. Scars on his face and hands betray a past that included some combat. Blane asks the group to stay the night so that the feuding families and town leaders can all meet.

Ned offers the group rooms for the night, at a considerable discount (1 gp for the lot).

Town meeting next day at noon at The Hook and Barrell. Key attendants are:

-   **Gavin Bernardedfeld** – partriarch of family; elderly human with balding head and scruffy gray beard.

-   **Abel Schruteborn** – patriarch of family; elderly human with reddish gray thin hair, no beard. Walks with a cane.

-   **Blane Coopersmith**

-   **Milton Sagegrove** – Sheriff of Edanshep. Tall, muscular human with chain armor and a large mace. Black beard and balding head.

-   **Holly Vangrade** – owner of the Brass Pot stock yards and grainery. Medium build human female with brown hair and green eyes. She has a stern manner.

-   **Burt Dhingel** – prominent local merchant. Well dressed with medium build, sandy brown hair, reddish beard and a warm handshake. He is very personable and talkative.

-   **Rod Stranglevine** – eldest priest in the village. Warm smile and handshake. Personable but not overbearing. Wears robes of modest fabric.

Group can decide what to recount to the gathering.

Interrupting the meeting is **Cyril Schruteborn**, a teenage member of the Schruteborn family. He exclaims that goblins, perhaps 6 or so were sighted not far from the Shruteborn farm. They were heading southward.

Goblin raiding party:

12 goblins

1 leader

1 worg

This is a short encounter for the group. These goblins have been a minor, but persistent bother to the town and local farmers. However, recently the worg and goblin leader have taken over control of the band. Their raids have become more brazzen and aggressive. They even tried to kidnap one of the Shruteborn family last month.

The goblins are interesting in the fissure-entrance to Valencourt’s tomb. The leader has been watching the fissure since the group first entered it and then emerged. Depending on how the group proceeds, the goblins might be within the tomb, exploring it for themselves. Otherwise the goblns will attack the group during the night; perferably when the group sets camp for the night.
