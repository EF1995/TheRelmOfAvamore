**5<sup>th</sup> Edition Adventure**

**King Valencourt’s Tomb**

**Summary**

In the pastoral region of Henallen, a small earthquake has created a fissure that reaches down into the burial complex of a long lost regent; King Valencourt. King Valencourt grew his kingdom and fortune through war and conquering. However, he spent the lion share of his fortune building this burial complex. The secret doors and magical enhancements came at a hefty price and left very little in his coffers. King Valencourt distrusted everyone, and none knew of him being on the verge of bankruptcy. At his death, it was widely believed that he had a vast fortune of silver, gold and gems.

**Setting**

Characters start in a bustling marketplace in the village of Edanshep. Above the dim of the crowd can be heard a disturbance of two men shouting. The crowd opens up a clearing for the two men and their respective entourages. Daggers and cudgels held at the ready and it is clear they intend to fight. Village leaders step in and careful diffuse the tension.

The conflict involves two families; the beet-farming Schruteborns and the sheep hearding Bernardenfelds. Gavin Bernardenfeld, patriarch of the family, accuses the Schruteborn’s collection of dogs for the disappearance of four of their sheep. The Schruteborns deny the accusation and are quick to point out that if it were true it would be just compensation for the crops that were damaged by the Bernardenfeld’s sheep. Neither party is willing to acknowledge the possibility that local bands of goblins could be behind this.

It is customary in this region for a group of impartial volunteers to investigate the situation. A call is put out to the crowd for volunteers. The characters are the group of volunteers.

**Region**

This is a farming and ranching community. Beets, carrots, potatoes, corn, barley and wheat are popular crops. Competing for land are sheep, goat and cow ranchers. For the most part, the constant threat of goblins and worgs unites both ranchers and farmers.

The area is characterized by lush rolling hills. A long, warm growing season with plenty of rain has contributed to the lush and productive region.

**The feud**

The feud between the Schruteborns and Bernardenfelds is an exception to the cooperative community of Edanshep. Most locals cannot remember a time when the families weren’t at each other’s throats.

**Investigation**

The party needs to find out where the two properties are and the likely area that the sheep would have disappeared.

*Persuasion check*. Locals as well as the arguing families can provide directions. Locals are DC 10 and families are DC 15. The families can give a much better description of the area of interest which will save 1 hour of searching.

Party follows directions which includes roads, single track paths and use of notable features like clusters of elms, the broken bridge over the river and where the river forks. Eventually, the party will find the area and suitable sheep tracks.

The party spends the next two hours following the sheep tracks around the countryside which is characterized by low rolling hills covered with tall grasses. Clusters of trees and bushes punctuate the otherwise rolling green grassy hills. The sheep largely moved as a heard, but often tracks were found away from those of the herd. One such set of meandering tracks ends at a sink hole. The sinkhole is roughly 10 feet in diameter and drops 15 feet straight down before angling eastward. Clumps of grass-covered soil breaks away from the edge if one steps close.

*Intelligence (Nature)* check

DC 10; the sinkhole is a recent development. The edges still crumble away.

DC 15; a small earthquake within the last two weeks may have contributed to the creation of this sinkhole.

DC 20; this area is not known for sinkholes, nor subsurface rivers. It was the custom of ancient cultures in this area to build burial crypts for royalty.

*Strength (Athletics)* check

DC 20 climb check without rope; DC 10 with rope. Falling damage is 1d6.

**Sinkhole**

In the first 15 the wall of the sinkhole is composed of soil with more rock material the deeper one descends. At the bottom is bedrock. A 5 foot wide crack in the bedrock reveals a narrow chasm that descends at an angle. There is a slight odor of rot coming from the dark chasm. Some source of illumination or darkvision is needed to proceed down the chasm.

*Strength (Athletics)* check x 2

DC 15 climb check without rope; DC 10 with rope. Failure means character slides down and knocks any characters in front of them prone. 1d4 damage.

The rotting smell gets stronger as characters descend. The passageway is uneven; very narrow in some places and wide in others. The surface is rough and the rock is jagged. Process is very slow at ¼ normal. The passageway opens into the ceiling of a man-made hallway. Rock, plaster, bricks and the rotting carcasses of three sheep lie on the floor eight feet below. Other than the characters’ scraping movements and breathing, there is an eerie silence. A small piece of rock falls to the floor from the crumbling ceiling; its impact on the floor below echoes in the hallway. Silence then returns.

**Hallway**

The hallway is five feet wide and eight feet tall. The breach in the ceiling reveals that it is lines with mud bricks covered with plaster. The walls and ceiling are smooth plaster finish. The floor is cobblestone; the stones and workmanship are superb. The walls are painted with murals for as far as the eye can see. Any movement by the party echoes in the hallway.

*Wisdom (Perception)* check; DC 15; the hallway is quite long in both directions.

Murals

The murals are scenes with the same figure as the focus. That figure is human with hide armor, spear, scepter and tall cone-shaped hat. It is larger than the other human figures in the murals. This figure is often painted leading other humans or in battle. Hunting is another theme that is found in the murals with this singular figure slaying all manner of beast with a bow. The King was also, apparently fond of drinking, eating and womanizing as there are murals with such themes.

*Intelligence (History)* check.

DC 10; murals are likely scenes in the life of a king

DC 15; the central figure was a king. The garb and weapon styles suggest a kingdom from over 500 years in the past.

DC20; one of the murals depicts a battle against a force composed of goblins and orcs. The last known collaboration of those two species was the battle of Marmorn. The city-state of Marmorn hired mercenary forces of both goblin and orcs to fend off invasion from King Valencourt. King Valencourt bribed the orcs and goblins with whiskey, elven slaves and gold. Marmon was quickly conquered and enslaved. While the goblins and orcs reveled in whiskey and raping, Valencourt’s troops surrounded their camp and massacred the lot.

DC 25, the King eat and drink himself to death at a banquet.

1.  **War room**

> Wooden door, bound with iron bands. No discernable locks or handles though the hinges on the right side suggest that it opens in the direction of the characters. The door is not locked and easily opens.

The floor is bare earth and appears to be packed down by booted-feet and horse hooves.
>
> Closer inspection of the walls reveals that they are covered in skins. Tattoos and scars on the skins suggest that it is humanoid in origin. The weapons and shields are not decorative. The weight, construction and markings strongly indicate that they were built for, and used in, battle. Collectors of antiquities would find the items valuable; from 2 – 3 times normal price for weapons and armor (Diplomacy check will determine extent).
>
> Skulls. If a character stands in a square next to the table, the skulls will begin to speak. While the language is common, the dialects and styles make it difficult to understand. Some phrases that can be discerned are:
>
> “Fortune favors the fallen”
>
> “Mercy, King Vallencourt, mercy”
>
> “Do what you will with the women and sheep, but leave me alone.”
