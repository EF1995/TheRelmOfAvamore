**Chapter 3: The Invitation**

**Summary**

Three weeks has passed since the last encounter with the goblins. They have yet to receive any visitors; the villagers are clearly scared of the site. Instead, the locals will only approach members of the group when they are in the village. This situation changes with the arrival of a messenger and his entourage.

Six soldiers on horse-back arrive late one afternoon. They bear a metallic scroll case. That case contains in invitation from Duke Borsz to meet to conclude legal documents related to the bequeathal of land from the two families to the group. He invites the group to Borsz Keep and asks that they inform the messenger of their answer so that proper arrangements can be made should they accept.

The Duke actually does have some legal rights to the land, which neither family knew about. At this early juncture of the site development, it would be wise to get the legalities settled. Borsz Keep is 20 miles to the south. The South Warden road can be taken for the entire route. Travel along the South Warden road is relatively safe; encounters with goblins occur occasionally. The main encounter will involve the Worg-rider luring a group of Gnoll hunters into the group’s camp while they are traveling to Borsz Keep.

**Data Gathering**

Monk: learning about Chamberlain and Valencourt

> The Monk spent considerable time contemplating the murals and maps in the tomb in search of insight into who Valencourt was. The murals spoke, superficially, to what Valencourt enjoyed. The royal court room and maps said much more about the man. He didn’t trust the nobility in the lands he conquered yet he made them part of his court. He must have been a master at reading people and negotiations.
>
> Chamberlain didn’t speak much about Valencourt. What he did say confirms that the King was an expert in spotting weaknesses and devising methods to take advantage of that weakness. He couldn’t read text, but he could read people.

Bard: Recruiting labor to work at the site is difficult.

Cleric: The Duke as bearer of a royal symbol (crook on pedestal) does have legal rights to the area.

Ranger: The worg-rider is still in the area.

Dwarves: The ground around the tomb is not well suited for tomb construction. The arched construction and some magical endowments are what keeps the tomb intact.

Magic user: All three schools of magic can be found in the Tomb; enchantment, evocation and illusion. Given the high level of mage needed to create the permanent magic and the fact that mages tend to specialize in a single school, Valencourt had access to multiple and powerful mages. Finding such skilled spell casters is a task in itself; not to mention the task of securing their services.

Fighters: The fissure is a poor tactical position; easily surrounded and the hill to the east provides a superior position from which to launch an attack. Defensive measures such as moat, trenches or wall cannot come fast enough.

**Encounters**

1.  Messengers

> A group of six humans on horseback approach the tomb. All are well armed and wearing chainmail armor. The lead rider introduces himself as Steriv Balthor, appointed representative of Duke Borscz. He asked if this is the site of King Valencourt’s tomb, and if so may he speak to a representative of the group in possession of the tomb.
>
> He produces a brass and leather scroll case and asks that a representative of the group take the scroll case; who so ever takes the scroll case must press the middle arcane symbol to activate the message.
>
> Message. When the symbol is touched a scroll rolls out from the bottom of the case. It reads:
>
> “*Greetings, my name is Duke Borscz, second son of Erom Borscz and great, great grandson of Duke Halig Bernard. It has come to my attention that the Schruteborn and Bernardenfeld families have relinquished a portion of their lands around King Valencourt’s tomb to you. It is my unpleasant task to inform you that they do not have the legal right to do so. The Accord of the 5<sup>th</sup> Court of Bernard provides my Dukedom with royal domain to these lands. Rest assured, a legal discord is not my intent. Rather, I invite you to my keep so that we may find an arrangement that is mutually beneficial. Please relay your response to my representative, Steriv. I hope that we may meet and come to an agreement that benefits all parties. *
>
> *Good fortune and health to you,*
>
> *Duke Borscz”*
>
> Steriv asks for the scroll case back. He will return in the morning to receive the group’s response.
>
> **Skill Checks**
>
> Insight (WIS)
>
> &lt; 10 Nothing of significance
>
> 10 – 15 Messengers appear to be quite serious about their mission
>
> &gt;15 The messengers are carefully evaluating the group and the area
>
> Search (Int)
>
> &lt; 10 Nothing
>
> 10 – 15 Their armor and arms are well-used; the equipment is not ceremonial
>
> &gt;15 There are slight variations in weapon types and armor types
>
> **Data Gathering**
>
> Cleric
>
> Legal records are often kept in churches. Inquiries with local churches will confirm the Duke’s assertion. There is a catch, that right is based on possession of a royal artifact; a crook (ref, shepard’s staff) upon a pedestal.
>
> Bard
>
> Asking around Edanshep, the bard learns that the Duke has never been to Edanshep. His representatives come monthly to collect taxes. Requests for assistance is taking care of the goblin problem fall on deaf ears.
>
> Fighter
>
> The messengers were mercenaries; their equipment displayed enough variation to indicate varied origins. The wear on the weapons and armor, and the manner of the messengers indicate that they are experienced fighters.
>
> Mage
>
> A magical scroll case is a rather expensive means of communication. However, the patina on the case and arcane script indicate that this item is quite old; perhaps 100 years or more.

1.  **On the Road**

> The journey should take two days on foot. The road is in decent shape and easily followed. It follows the rolling hills that predominate the southern region. Dense forests border open spaces which in frequent cases is used a pasture for flocks of sheep and goats. Travelers encountered are local farmers and ranchers. All are armed. They are approachable, but somewhat cautious of strangers.
>
> The goblin worg-rider follows the group, deviating from their trail occasionally to scout the surrounding area. When they make camp he pesters a group of Gnoll hunters into chasing him.
>
> He rides through the group’s camp, dropping a smoke bomb. The Gnolls charge into the smoke and attack the group.
>
> Loot: Gnolls – 17 sp, 6 gp each; 3 healing potions and 1 potion of climbing
>
> Loot: Packlord – 10 gp, 4 moss agate gems worth 10 gp each; 1 healing potion
