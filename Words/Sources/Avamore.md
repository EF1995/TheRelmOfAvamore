**REALM OF AVAMORE**

Avamore is the name of a place, a species of tree and an emerging state. It is also the namesake for this campaign setting. As such, it is entirely fictitious; a product of our imagination with roots in the Dungeon and Dragons, 2014 game rules release.

Geographically, the setting is a v-shaped continent; Avamore is located in the more northern region of the continent. The northernmost region is a juxtaposition of high mountain ranges known as the Draken Mountains, glaciers and a string of active volcanoes. Many refer to this area and the Burning Rift. It is also known as, Blacksnow as the discharge of frequent eruptions often returns as dark ash or ash-tainted snow. North of the Burning Rift is a sea of snow and ice that extends to the northern pole.

Nestled below the Draken Mountains is a region called the Sea of Shimmering Gold. It is a relatively flat region grassland that is home to Avamore. In fall, the grasses turn a golden color which shimmers and sways in the autumn breezes, mimicking the motion of waves in a sea. Avamore is an island in this shimmering sea.

A cluster of seven trees comprise the physical location of Avamore and are central to Avamoreâ€™s social, political and economic state. The Avamore tree is a notable species for its sheer size and reach; the tops of each tree in Avamore is in excess of a thousand feet. Their broad base of branching roots can cover over ten acres. Three cultures call the Avamore trees home; dwarves live amongst the roots, humans upon the ground and roots and elves within the branches. All three depend upon the Avamore tree and necessarily have learned to coexist as three interdependent states. This coexistence can at times be contentious and tense. Ultimately, however, such interdependence and cooperation has resulted in a growing prosperity and power. Avamore, as a state, is becoming a powerful entity whose reach and influence is extending beyond the shores of the Sea of Shimmering Gold.

Two inland seas, the West and East Twin Seas, separate the Sea of Shimmering Gold from the southern portion of the continent. Seven states occupy this region; Kaharn, Tolov, Adyk, Caracal, Aktar, Urln and Borscz. The geography of the land aligns somewhat to these states. Kaharn extends from the western shore to the western slope of the Tolov Mountains and north to the shores of the West Twin sea. Rolling hills and moist airs from the ocean and seas provide for a well-watered region that is agriculturally productive from the flatlands of the shoreline to the rolling hills next to the Tolov Mountains.

The Tolov state is a mountainous region that extends from the western coast north to the land between the Twin Seas.

Off of the eastern slope of the Tolov Mountains is the Burning Dust desert and the Adyk state. Adyk is entirely subterranean. Subterranean cultures and races have expanded naturally occurring tunnels, shafts and caverns into a network of mines, fungus farms and waterways.

Nestled between the twin seas, and the Burning Dust Desert to the south, is the Borscz state. Rolling hills to the south and swamplands to the north characterize this state.
